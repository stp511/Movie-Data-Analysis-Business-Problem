 Create and Analyze a Movie Database to Predict Successful Movies

Several files from IMDB's movie data set have been downloaded and filtered into a subset according to stakeholder specifications.  Additionally, an API has been used to extract and add box office revenue and profit data to the subset of movies.  Exploratory data analysis has been performed on this subset of movies.  

A MySQL database has been constructed and exported with this data.

Hypothesis testing has been applied to explore what makes a movie successful and a Linear Regression model has been used to predict movie performance.
